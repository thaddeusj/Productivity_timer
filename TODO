Completed:
1: Timer setup
	- allow user to set timer, start timer, have the timer count down
	- timer should minimise self after 5 (arbitrary amount) seconds and regain focus when the timer goes off

	- give user option of a few presets
	- ask for task

2: Timer cancel
	- user may cancel a timer in progress
	- cancelling a timer prompts the user to input a reason
	- aside from this, timers may not be paused

3: Timeout
	- after the timer runs down, ask user whether they're still doing the given task

4: Set up database
	- data about timers should be stored in a database. Need to store:
		- date and time of timer start
		- duration
		- whether the timer was cancelled or was allowed to run down
		- if cancelled, what the reason was
		- if allowed to run down, whether user was still working or not

5: Database viewing
	- set up viewing for database information
	- prominantly display success vs failure, and premature cancellations	
	- Need to design the interface for this

Optional tasks:

2: Support for multiple users
	- store data in separate files for each user? or something else
	
3: If multiple users is supported, should implement user authentication as well

Still TODO:

Optional tasks:

1: Database statistics
	- for example, success rate, cancellation rate, average duration, etc.
